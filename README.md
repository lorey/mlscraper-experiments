# mlscraper-experiment

Trying some ideas to extend my main library [mlscraper](https://github.com/lorey/mlscraper).

## Terminology
* Scraper: turn a page into an item by scraping HTML
* Extractor: how to get the value out of a DOM node
* Selector: an algorithm to select nodes
* Combination Strategy: a way to combine extractors and selectors to actual lists, dicts or values
